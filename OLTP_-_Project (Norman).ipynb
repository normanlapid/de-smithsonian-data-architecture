To control pitch, the pilot pivoted this wing by moving a control stick fore and aft. Mignet mounted a second wing firmly fixed to the top of the fuselage behind the pilot. To turn, the pilot moved a rudder surface by swinging the control stick left or right. A generous amount of dihedral built into both wings caused the airplane to automatically bank when turning.

Government officials in both France and Britain banned flights and subjected the HM.14 to wind tunnel tests. The results showed that under certain flight conditions, the pilot could not recover from a dive. Based on their findings, Mignet soon modified the design and solved most of the problems but the bubble of public infatuation with the Flea had burst.

Nirmaier had adhered closely to Mignet&#x27;s plans in constructing the aircraft, deviating only in the methods used to weld several parts.

It flew well, but on the first day, a gust of wind flipped it over while taxiing. Nirmaier quickly repaired the damage and took the aircraft aloft for a short flight two days later. This became the Crosley Flea&#x27;s last flight. Meet organizers awarded the HM.14 a trophy (see NASM collection) for efficient construction and operation, but the aircraft remained grounded for good.</td>\n",

They saved the Flea and placed the small aircraft in a barn owned by insurance adjuster Walter Paner. It remained there until 1957 when vintage aircraft enthusiast Patrick Packard tracked it down. He purchased the Flea minus its wheels and engine but Pat located Ed Nirmaier and reclaimed the original wheels that Nirmaier had installed on his lawnmower. Pat donated the aircraft to the Smithsonian in about 1960. In 1991 the Experimental Aircraft Association Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, borrowed the Flea and Pat Packard and Patti Koppa undertook a full restoration. Pat reproduced an accurate wooden replica of the missing, original ABC Scorpion engine.</td>\n",

Her sister, Karen &quot;Bear&quot; Ride, believed that Ride&#x27;s habit of memorizing and analyzing batting averages and pitching statistics bolstered her early interest in mathematics. Ride soon focused her attention on tennis, and as a college student she was a nationally ranked tennis player.</td>\n",

Hall and Charles A. Lindbergh, built a long-range monoplane based on the Ryan M-2. Lindbergh christened the modified M-2 the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis.&quot; It is said that Bowlus suggested several design features that Lindbergh approved and incorporated in the finished airplane. Bowlus renewed his friendship with Lindbergh late in 1929. He taught the ocean flyer and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to fly sailplanes and in January 1930, both Charles and Anne completed their first solo glider flights.</td>\n",

He and German glider pioneer Martin Schempp taught courses in aircraft design and construction at the Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute in Glendale, California. The two instructors led a group of students who built the Super Sailplane in 1932. The wing of the Super was nearly a copy of the wing used on the German &quot;Wein&quot; sailplane designed and flown with great success in 1930 and 1931 by Robert Kronfeld. Both the Super Sailplane and the Senior Albatross employed the same Goettingen 549 wing airfoil and even the tips of the control surfaces curved to almost identical contours. When Bowlus built the Senior Albatross series, the cockpit enclosure closely resembled another record-setting and influential German sailplane called the &quot;Fafnir&quot; and designed by Alexander Lippisch specifically for pilot Gunther Groenhoff.</td>\n",

Its side-by-side, dual-control cockpit arrangement offered a difference in cockpit configuration and the original cantilever wings were bolted directly to the upper center section strut and the lower fuselage with no interplane struts or external flying wires. However, just as Anthony Fokker did on his WWI era DR-1Triplane and D-VII Biplane, struts were soon added as an option to assuage the fears of wary customers who wondered if the wings might collapse.</td>\n",

The experimental prototype, the Model 23-1, was a four-place, steel tube-and-fabric, low-wing airplane with a fixed tricycle landing gear and a twin tail. It was powered by two 125 hp Lycoming O-290D engines. Flight tests in 1952 indicated that the airplane was under-powered and had some control response and vibration problems. Correction of these difficulties resulted in the complete redesign of the airplane, including all-metal construction, a single vertical fin, retractable landing gear, and 150 hp Lycoming 0-320-A engines with constant speed propellers.

With a series of exhaust valve failures and a crank shaft failure during the engine and flight tests, the finall CAA certification was delayed until July 30, 1948.

The navy also stipulated that assembling and launching the three M6A1s should require no more than 30 minutes. To fit inside a 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in) diameter, cylinder-shaped hangar, Ozaki designed the main wing spar to rotate 90° once the deck crew removed the two floats. After rotating the wings, the crew folded them back to lie flat against the fuselage. About 2/3 of the each side of the horizontal stabilizer also folded down, likewise the tip of the vertical stabilizer.

However, progress virtually stopped after a major earthquake severely disrupted the production line in December 1944. Boeing B-29 bomber raids further disrupted the project. As the war deteriorated in March 1945, the Navy curtailed the submarine program. The first I-400 was finished on December 30, 1944, and the I-401 followed a week later. But I-402 was converted into a submarine fuel tanker and work ended on I-404 and 405. With the submarine fleet now reduced, the Navy required fewer Seirans so this program was also curtailed.

A metal flap bore damage-probably the result of a bombing raid-hastily covered with fabric patches. They found the interior of fuel tanks contaminated with paper documents.

Development of the aircraft began under the direction of chief engineer Edward H. Heinemann. Subsequent analysis of captured data on wartime German sweptwing research, combined with sweptwing studies by American scientist Robert T. Jones, caused Douglas and the Navy to modify the D-558 contract by deleting three of the planned aircraft and replacing them with three sweptwing vehicles powered by both tu4bojet and rocket engines. The first three aircraft, each powered by a single General Electric TG-180 turbojet, became known as the D-558-1 Skystreak series.

The more powerful D558-2, using its 6,000-pound-thrust rocket engine fueled with liquid oxygen and diluted ethyl alcohol, could easily exceed Mach 1.

Soon the modified, or hybrid Rogallo, appeared. These gliders had higher nose angles and longer wingspans. As before, steel wires braced the whole structure to increase strength and improve performance. This version proved much safer than the standard Rogallos, which could be unstable in moderate winds and turbulence. On the early standards, the sails attached to the leading edges and keel tube only, leaving large areas of material loose. All was well if the pilot maintained stable forward flight. The swept leading edges created vortexes that billowed the sail into a stable concave shape. But in turbulence or during a stall, one or both sides of the wing could deflate and collapse, or &#x27;luff,&#x27; causing the glider to drop out of control. With more pilots foot-launching off of high rough terrain, hang gliding injuries and fatalities rose, accelerating the transition to modified Rogallo designs.</td>\n",

Langley&#x27;s simple approach was merely to scale up the unpiloted Aerodromes of 1896 to human-carrying proportions. The construction details and distribution of stresses on the Aerodrome A, as the full-sized version was called, were based on the successful performance of a gasoline-powered model, one-fourth the size.

Between 1901 and 1903, the engine was rebuilt to produce slightly more than three horsepower, after which a final flight of 308 m (1,000 ft) was made on August 8, 1903. Because the structural and control requirements for a full-sized, piloted airplane were very different, the satisfactory flights of the Quarter-scale Aerodrome masked its flaws as a design prototype for the Aerodrome A.

He became the third Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1887. Langley had begun serious investigation into heavier-than-air flight several years earlier while at the then Western University of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh (now the University of Pittsburgh). He had erected a huge, 18.3 m (60 ft) diameter whirling arm at the university&#x27;s Allegheny Observatory to perform aerodynamic research. At full speed, the tips of the whirling arm approached seventy miles per hour. Langley mostly ran tests with flat plates, but he also mounted small model airplanes he called aerostats, and even stuffed birds, on the arm. He also conducted an extensive series of experiments with rubber band-powered models.</td>\n",

He then moved away from purely theoretical aerodynamic research, and began work aimed at engineering an actual flying machine. In 1891, he started to experiment with large, tandem-winged models, approximately 4 m (13 ft) in wingspan, powered by small steam and gasoline engines. Another large whirling arm, 9 m (29.5 ft) in diameter, was set up at the Smithsonian to test curved wing shapes and propellers, probably in connection with the design of these large powered models that Langley called aerodromes.</td>\n",

It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made that afternoon, one of 1,005 m (3,300 ft) and a second of 700 m (2,300 ft), at a speed of approximately 25 miles per hour.

       "            <td>Claudius Dornier patented the push-pull engine layout in 1937, which was innovative because it offered the power of two engines but less drag and greater maneuverability than other twin-engine configurations. The RLM (German Aviation Ministry) wanted to support development of push-pull aircraft but initially only as seaplanes and bombers. By 1942, the Luftwaffe needed multi-role fighters and after submitting a proposal in January 1943 for a Schnellbomber (fast bomber), Dornier built a prototype Do 335 V-1 (‘V’ for Versuchs or experimental) and the aircraft completed its first flight in September 1943. Following initial testing, the RLM ordered 14 prototypes, ten preproduction aircraft with the suffix designation A-0, eleven production A-1 single-seat aircraft, and 3 A-10 and A-12 two-seat trainers.</td>\n",

Each engine displaced 44.5 liters (2,670 cu in) and weighed 910 kg (2,006 lb). Unlike conventional twin-engine aircraft with wing-mounted engines, the Do 335 would not yaw sharply to one side if one engine failed, and single-engine flying speed remained respectable at about 620 km/h (345 mph). Pilots reported exceptional flight performance in acceleration and turning radius, and docile handling with no dangerous spin characteristics. In an emergency, however, the pilot could detonate explosive bolts and jettison the pusher three-blade propeller and dorsal fin to increase the chances of successfully bailing out using the pneumatic ejection seat. When fired, the seat pushed the pilot away from the aircraft with a force of about 20 Gs.</td>\n",

Although combat conversion units received several pre-production aircraft about 10 months before the war ended, no pilots flew Do 335s in combat. Only one example of the first production version Do 335A-1 rolled off the Dornier assembly line at Friedrichshafen just before the war ended.

By June 22, 1971, it was assigned to Fighting Squadron 31 (VF-31) stationed at the Naval Air Station (NAS), Oceana, Virginia. Early in 1972, VF-31, (with F-4 Bu. No. 157307) went aboard USS Saratoga, and by April en route to the western Pacific for duty in the Vietnam War. On May 18, 1972, the squadron started combat operations on Yankee Station, off the coast of Vietnam. While on a flight on June 21, 1972, its last day on station, F-4 Bu. No. 157307 (Squadron No. 106) made its mark. It was launched that day on a MIGCAP (MiG Combat Air Patrol) with VF-31&#x27;s Executive Officer, Cdr. S.C. Flynn, USN, as pilot, and Lt. W.H. John as the Radar Intercept Officer (RIO). This was not their regularly assigned airplane. They spotted 3 MiGs and in the ensuing engagement shot down one MiG-21 with a Sidewinder missile (AIM-9).

A light provided a further warning that the stall had occurred and a recovery was underway. Like the autopilot itself, the Stallemometer was not seen by aviators as a desirable innovation due to cost, weight, complexity and its subsuming of pilot control over the flight.

The windshield and cabin windows are formed of stretched, laminated, acrylic plastic. The ailerons, elevators, and rudder are mechanically connected to the cockpit controls, while all trim surfaces are electrically operated. There is a small tab on the left aileron for roll and one on the rudder for yaw. The incidence angle of the horizontal stabilizer is changed for pitch trim control. The aircraft has spoilers for speed control on the upper surface of each wing panel forward of the flaps. These are actuated by hydraulic pressure, as is the fully retractable landing gear and multiple disc brakes on the dual mail wheels. As a matter of aerodynamic design, the fuselage narrows at each side as the wing and engine nacelles extend outward.

The submarine commanders moved their patrols far out to sea to avoid Allied air cover and roaming destroyers. High sea states in these open waters restricted visibility to several kilometers or less, and U-boat commanders were hard-pressed to acquire targets. The expanse of the open ocean also worsened the target detection problem. Near the coast, Allied ships traveled in relatively narrow areas. A U-boat could wait, just beneath the waves in daylight or float on the surface at night, and expect with some certainty that a target would steam within detection range. Away from the coast, U-boats had to patrol much larger areas and this reduced the chances of detecting Allied ships.

One tube contained the blades and tail and the other contained the fuselage. Four crewmen could assemble the entire structure in three minutes in calm conditions. Rotation of the blades in preparation for flight could be done by hand, but if a course pitch (which provided the best operating performance) was preset on the rotor blades this became extremely difficult. In that case, a rope wrapped around drum on the rotor hub was used to get the rotor turning. The Fa 330 took off from a small platform attached to the aft railing of the U-boat&#x27;s conning tower. A towline extended from an electric winch to a quick release coupling on the Fa 330. Since the primary duty of the Fa 330 was to spot suitable targets, communication with the towing vessel was essential. The pilot used an interphone system that consisted of a telephone cable, which paralleled the towline. Upon landing a rotor brake was provided to quickly stop the rotor spinning. Disassembly time was not much greater than that required for assembly. If the U-boat came under attack and had to make a crash dive the pilot could pull a quick release lever above the seat, and the towline would separate from the aircraft in addition to releasing the rotor hub from the mast. As the rotors departed they pulled a line out, which deployed a parachute. Once the parachute opened, the pilot released his seat buckle, which allowed the remainder of the aircraft structure to fall away.

The first operational deployment of the type occurred in April 1943 aboard U 177, which managed to sink one vessel on August 5 with the aid of the Fa 330.</td>\n",

       "            <td>Operational details of the Fa 330&#x27;s combat service are almost nonexistent after the U 177 deployment. This is undoubtedly because of the extremely high loss rate among U-boats, which has meant that very few ships&#x27; logs have survived. There were several concerns that prevented wider employment of the Fa 330. A U-boat commander was faced with a choice between risking his entire vessel and crew to recover the pilot, or to crash dive the submarine and leave the unfortunate individual to suffer an almost certain death, in the event that the submarine had been spotted, in addition to the fact that it gave away the U-boats primary advantage - stealth. It appears that some U-boat commanders who were not enamored with the Fa 330 took the opportunity to trade them to the Japanese in exchange for floatplanes to patrol around U-boat bases in Java and Malaya. The Japanese Navy enjoyed more success with submarine launched aircraft. They had several classes of large submarines that could carry, launch and recover seaplanes capable of carrying reasonable weapon loads and which would not give away the submarine&#x27;s position.</td>\n",

It bears the captured aircraft registration number of T2-4618, but it appears likely that the museum&#x27;s aircraft is actually T2-4616, which was in a display example of captured German technology at Freeman Field in 1946. The Army Air Force then loaned it to Eastern Rotor Craft of Pennsylvania in 1947 for an evaluation after which it into storage for the National Air Museum. T2-4618 conducted a number of flight tests at Wright Field in 1946, during which it was equipped with a wheeled landing gear and towed by a truck. However the relatively large landing gear upset the center-of-gravity and made the aircraft difficult to takeoff and land. After four successful flights the aircraft rolled on landing and sustained some damage. The aircraft was repaired and sent to MacDill Air Force Base for further testing in 1948. There it was towed behind a boat, minus the wheeled undercarriage, for consideration as an aid for U.S. Air Force small rescue boats in spotting downed airmen in the water. Unfortunately in August 1948 the towline broke and the aircraft sank in Tampa Bay, but pilot Capt. Raymond A. Popson managed to escape. The aircraft mysteriously disappeared from where it sank and rumors state that it may have turned up in an army surplus store over twenty years later.</td>\n",

The first was the dramatic shift from so-called “manned” to Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). This shift had occurred slowly over much of the twentieth century as cruise missiles, target drones, and autopilots narrowed the role of onboard human pilots. The MQ-1 and other RPAS consist of “air vehicles” and ground-control equipment connected to the air vehicle by radio and satellite data links. In most RPAS, including the Predator, humans are essential to their routine operation. While no one flies on the Predator, and it often cruises under control of an autopilot, most of its functions occur at the hands of a pilot, sensor operator, and mission intelligence coordinator in the ground-control station. In this way, the Predator is more “manned” than many other combat aircraft.</td>\n",

In military parlance, the Predator “closed the sensor-to-shooter cycle” (i.e., the time between the identification of the target and the strike) and “accelerated the kill chain.” The use of the Predator as an “aerial sniper” ushered in a new form of warfare with its own cultural and geopolitical implications.</td>\n",

Authority for Predator development came under the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, nicknamed “Big Safari,” which had responsibility for rapid development of reconnaissance systems outside conventional “mil-spec” airworthiness standards, resulting in a capable, but fragile, aircraft. In the late 1990s, Big Safari expanded the Predator’s capability to include a laser designator to illuminate targets and guide weapons dropped from other aircraft, reducing the sensor-to-shooter cycle. In 1999, this system had its first significant test during Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. One lesson learned was that the sensor-to-shooter cycle was still too great, as sometimes strike aircraft struggled to locate targets spotted by Predator.

Given the requirement to make executive-level decisions about priority terrorist targets that might appear only briefly, the ability to watch Predator video and control the aircraft from the other side of the world in real time took on increased urgency. While Big Safari continued development in the United States, it also secretly operated several Predators from a base in Uzbekistan with the CIA during the summer and fall of 2000 to locate Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. This paid off in September, with two and possibly three successful sightings, but President Clinton’s administration had not yet made a decision on direct military action against bin Laden, so the Predators soon returned to the United States. These operations also validated what would become the standard operational profile of the Predator in which a launch-and-recovery team at the operating airfield oversaw the takeoff and landing, but then passed control to a remote ground-control station via satellite, where a different crew managed the mission.</td>\n",

Determined not to repeat the mistake, Petter sought opinions from the Royal Army squadrons that would operate the new aircraft, and he even interviewed his own engineers and pilots.

To boost the low-speed characteristics of the airfoil, the wing was thickest at about mid-span but shrank by nearly half at the wing roots. Viewed head-on, the wing bends slightly like the wing of a seagull. The inboard, leading edges tapered toward the tail to allow the pilot to see through the top of the canopy during very steep turns, and the outboard trailing edges tapered forward to give the airplane a snappy roll rate, again to improve maneuvering at slow speeds. To make very slow speed flight possible, the P.8 was the first British service aircraft equipped with trailing edge flaps and leading edge slats. These devices operated automatically and no action by the pilot was required.</td>\n",

The Lysander could locate airmen downed at sea and drop them life rafts and supplies. Because an amphibious invasion by German forces could come at anytime, a number of modifications for the Lysander were also proposed. Most involved increasing the armament to make the airplane effective at repelling invaders that managed to land on Britain&#x27;s shores. One proposal sought to add a 20mm canon to each undercarriage leg. Other ideas included adding a ventral gun position (a version nicknamed the &quot;pregnant perch&quot;), or turrets behind the wings or near the tail. The tail turret also necessitated a revised stabilizer with two vertical fins and rudders. Late in 1940, the threat of invasion eased and none of these modifications was adopted.</td>\n",

The offer was accepted and the three airplanes were delivered to the museum on September 16 and 17, 1918. The Farman was very incomplete and was deemed unacceptable for exhibition. It was returned to the War Department in June 1921. (Because of an oversight when packing the Farman for shipment, its wings remained at the Smithsonian until September 1925, when they were either returned to the War Department or destroyed. The record is unclear.)</td>\n",

He then proceeded to test fly the aircraft, while at the same time, teaching himself how to fly. After the formation of the school and construction of another aircraft, Bellanca began instructing from the ground as students experimented with short hops in the single-seat aircraft.

The fuselage had a hump shape, similar to an airfoil that required the pilot, sitting aft of the cabin and off center to the left, to look under the left wing of the aircraft for side and some forward visibility. The struts of the aircraft were also airfoil shape and thus assisted with lift in flight, rather than just supporting the high single wing. Balsa wood, for lightness, formed the leading edge of the two-spar strut. The wooden-frame fuselage was covered with mahogany plywood panels around the cabin and tail area and with fabric on the aft fuselage and on the wings, struts, and flying tail surfaces. The cabin accommodated four passengers and had five small windows on each side. The aircraft was powered by a 95 hp Anzani engine. Harry G. Smith, an airmail pilot, took the C.F. up for its first flight on June 8, 1922, and he reported the aircraft&#x27;s favorable stability and maneuverability in banking, loops and rolls.</td>\n",

He did most of the fundamental design work on the firm&#x27;s aircraft after 1916. Anthony Fokker&#x27;s talents were greater as a test pilot than as a designer. He had an innate ability to fly an experimental aircraft and know just what improvements needed to be made to turn it into a successful performer.

On January 23, famed German ace, Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, flew the V.11 at Fokker&#x27;s request. Richthofen thought the airplane was maneuverable and had generally good performance, but that it was tricky to handle and directionally unstable, especially in a dive. Ritchhofen&#x27;s assessment confirmed Fokker&#x27;s own impression of the V.11 from his brief testing of the airplane before the competition began. To remedy these problems, Fokker lengthened the fuselage 40 cm (16 in), added a fixed vertical fin and a new rudder shape, and altered the aileron balances, among other small changes. With these modifications, the V.11 was safe and pleasant to fly, and had lost little of the maneuverability that had initially impressed von Richthofen. The Red Baron flew the improved V.11 and now found the airplane delightful to handle. He urged other pilots at the competition to try it, and they also thought the design was very promising. Given his stature, the endorsement of von Richthofen went far towards the selection of the V.11 as the winner of the competition.</td>\n",

The Johannisthal-built aircraft carried the designation Fokker D.VII (Alb) and those constructed at Schneidemühl were identified Fokker D.VII (O.A.W.). Because the Fokker factory produced no construction drawings, working only from jigs and assembly sketches, Albatros had to make its own drawings, based on a completed airframe obtained from Fokker. This, in addition to each firm applying its own construction techniques and standards, resulted in Fokker D.VIIs that looked alike, but differed in detail. Thus, not all components were interchangeable on airplanes built at the three factories. Moreover, the aircraft built by Albatros were generally considered to be of higher quality than those produced by the primary contractor, Fokker. Interestingly, more Fokker D.VIIs were produced by Albatros than by Fokker, with a total for all three factories of approximately 1,000 aircraft.</td>\n",

Personnel at Weedhopper installed a lower fabric surface that extended from the leading edge back to cover about three-quarters of the wing and they narrowed, but did not completely seal, the wingroot gap.

       "            <td>Weedhoppers cost less to purchase than other ultralights because the design was very simple. There was no gas gauge. The pilot estimated the fuel level by observing the liquid through the sides of the opaque gas tank. Nosewheel steering was manual and the pilot used his feet to push an aluminum tube that pivoted the wheel left or right. Chotia designed the wing without aileron control surfaces. He used only conventional flight controls (elevator and rudder) on the tail to guide the airplane. Fast aircraft not only cost more to design, they are more expensive to operate. Weedhopper pilots set no speed records as they cruised sedately above the earth at about 43-56 km/h (30-35 mph), but the exhilarating experience of flight also cost them no more than a few dollars. Keeping the Weedhopper simple and slow allowed Chotia to sell the aircraft as a kit, complete with engine, for $4,095 in 1982. In 2002, ultralight pilots could purchase an improved Weedhopper model 40 kit, complete with a Rotax 447 engine, for $7,995. Low purchase and operating costs helped Chotia&#x27;s original company, Weedhopper of Utah Inc., sell more than 3,000 Weedhopper B models, plus another 2,500 C models.

On March 20, 1937, Earhart crashed on takeoff at Luke Field, Honolulu, Hawaii, ending her westbound world flight that had begun at Oakland, California. The Electra was returned to Lockheed Aircraft Company in Burbank, California, for extensive repairs. On June 1, 1937, Earhart began an eastbound around-the-world flight from Oakland, via Miami, Florida, in the Electra with Fred Noonan as her navigator. They reached Lae, New Guinea on June 29, having flown 22,000 miles with 7,000 more to go to Oakland. They then departed Lae on July 2 for the 2,556-mile flight to their next refueling stop, Howland Island, a two-mile long and less-than-a-mile wide dot in the Pacific Ocean.</td>\n",

Bowlus and Mitchell stated working early in February 1937 and completed the aircraft one year later. While Mitchell worked almost around-the-clock for several months, Bowlus could spare only nights and weekends as he struggled to support his wife, Ruth, and their four children. The first prototype differs from the later versions in some important ways: Bowlus used cables for aileron control rather than heavier, but more precise, push rods. He also skinned the ailerons with plywood but chose not to rig them to move differentially to minimize adverse yaw. The elevators are the same type fitted to the Senior Albatross.

The scarf joint refers to the careful and time-consuming method of shaping the plywood edges to meet at precise angles with no gaps. Wood workers had to shape each piece differently to fit the continuously curved surface of the pod. Precision was important to give the weak casein glue as much surface as possible with to bond. To manufacturer pods for the kits, Bowlus abandoned the laborious scarf-jointed pod and adopted a technique similar to that used by Lockheed to build fuselages for the Vega, Orion, and Altair monoplanes flown by Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart, Roscoe Turner, Charles Lindbergh, and other record-setting flyers during the 1920s and 1930s. Crafts persons layered .07 cm (1/32 inch) mahogany and poplar plywood veneer into a wooden mold with glue sandwiched between the layers. They then placed an inflatable bag over the wet layers, and lowered a concrete male mold down into the wooden mold and bolted it securely a few inches above the bag. The crafts persons inflated the bag so that it evenly applied about (10 lb/in²) to the whole inside of the pod skin, and set aside the mold aside to dry. After waiting several days, they removed the finished halves, trimmed and dressed them, and glued and nailed the shells to the internal framework. A molded pod sped construction because it required only six frames versus eleven for the scarf-jointed pods used for the prototypes.</td>\n",

       "            <td>The cockpit was too narrow to accommodate a conventional, three-axis, control stick. To permit the pilot to roll the sailplane, Bowlus copied the arrangement he had used in the Senior Albatross and mounted a smart-looking &#x27;butterfly&#x27; wheel on top of a stick. By pushing a set of conventional rudder pedals, the pilot controlled yaw, and a simple panel presented the essential instruments: altitude, airspeed, and compass. A competent pilot could fly the Baby Albatross at a maximum lift-to-drag ratio of 19:1 at 56 km/h (35 mph). Bowlus set the never-exceed speed, at 100 km/h (62 mph). The Baby Albatross was capable of doing well in soaring contests in the hands of experienced pilots. Unfortunately, the design of the elevator control made the aircraft sensitive about the pitch axis, something that new pilots had to approach with great care. Operating the aircraft for several years revealed that that neither the streamlined wooden shell around the cockpit, nor the aluminum castings used for fittings in areas subjected to high stress, were durable enough. Despite these shortcomings, the design became the most successful aircraft that Bowlus developed. Such respected names in the aviation industry as Jack Frye, president of Transcontinental &amp; Western Airlines, Rubin Fleet at Consolidated Aircraft, engine builder Al Menasco, Glenn L. Martin, Jack Northrop, and Donald Douglas backed the production of the kits and kept the cost down to less than one-third the price of a Senior Albatross.

Among the group were pilots who accomplished significant flights at the controls of their Baby Albatrosses. Eastern Airlines Captain J. Shelly Charles of Atlanta made a number of impressive flights. He flew 423 km (263 miles) on one occasion and later soared to an altitude of more than 3,040 m (10,000 ft). On 6 June 1939, Woody Brown flew his Baby Albatross, &quot;Thunder Bird,&quot; a distance of 451 km (280 miles) from Wichita Falls, Texas, to Wichita, Kansas, a U. S. National record for distance flown to a declared goal. Dick Johnson&#x27;s first win at the U. S. nationals came in 1940 at the controls of a Baby Albatross. According to Bowlus records, Florence &quot;Pancho Barnes&quot; Lowe, bought serial number 118 and kit units 1, 2, 3, and 4 were shipped to her by 15 December 1939, but no further information is known. After World War II, a saloon owned by Lowe at Muroc, California, called the Happy Bottom Riding Club, became a favorite meeting place for test pilots such as Scott Crossfield and Chuck Yeager.</td>\n",

There are gaps in the airplane&#x27;s history, however it is known that Mitchell clocked 273 hours while flying it. He and the sailplane were towed aloft by almost every conceivable means: automobile, airplane (40-hp Piper Cub), pulley, winch, and bungee-launch. On one memorable occasion, as eager listeners monitored his live broadcast from the cockpit, horses ridden by the Hollywood celebrities Edgar Bergan, Andy Devine, and Don Wilson, towed Mitchell and the sailplane into the air at the Grand Central Airport in Glendale, California. NBC radio carried the performance live. Mitchell and the competition pilot, Jack O&#x27;Meara, took the aircraft to the 1938 U. S. National Glider Contest held at Harris Hill in Elmira, New York.

Horace E. Tennes purchased the sailplane and the following month, Ed W. Hudlow, Aeronautical Inspector, Civil Aeronautics Administration, issued an Airplane Tow Permit to Tennes to tow the sailplane behind a powered aircraft. During the spring of 1940, the Navy assigned Tennes to Fighter Squadron VF-6 based at Naval Air Station Coronado, California.

Check ship thoroughly.&quot; On 8 July 1941, authorities authorized Tennes to conduct &quot;experimental testing within the 6th CAA Region.&quot; At the time, Tennes was stationed at Naval Air Station San Diego, California the details about these experiments remain unknown. Later that year, a startling development occurred when Tennes loaded his Baby Albatross aboard the aircraft carrier Enterprise and sailed with the sailplane to Hawaii. Whether Tennes or anyone else flew NX18979 while overseas remains a mystery but the naval officer went on to command fighter squadron VF-86, nicknamed the Wild Hares, from June 1944 to January 12, 1945, and fighter-bomber squadron VBF-86, nicknamed the Vapor Trails, until the unit disestablished on November 21, 1945.</td>\n",

On February 25, 1941, General Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, Deputy Chief of Staff for Air (later commanding general of the AAF), wrote to Dr. Vannevar Bush, chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), asking him to form a special group to consider jet aircraft propulsion. Bush complied the following month and the &quot;Special Committee on Jet Propulsion&quot; included representatives from the Army Air Corps, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, National Bureau of Standards, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the three U. S. manufacturers of various industrial turbines and turbo-superchargers for reciprocating aircraft engines, Allis Chalmers, Westinghouse, and General Electric.</td>\n",

A W.1X turbojet engine designed by Frank Whittle powered the E.28/39. Arnold returned to the U. S. in May and briefed members of the AAF Engineering Division at Wright Field, Ohio, and the U. S. State Department. Efforts began to exchange information on this technology and on July 22, 1941, British and American officials met to discuss it. On September 4, officials of the U. S. government, the Army Air Forces, and the General Electric company met and decided that the United States must begin at once to construct 15 jet turbine aircraft engines (copies of a new Whittle engine, the W.2B) and three jet airplanes. The Whittle engine was not overly powerful so the group chose a twin-engine configuration for the new jet. General Electric was selected to build the engines because the firm was already familiar with the Gloster aircraft and the Whittle engine. Several factors influenced the group&#x27;s decision to select the Bell Aircraft Corporation to build the new fighter.</td>\n",

The group also considered Larry Bell&#x27;s enthusiasm and reputation for making unorthodox designs fly. On September 5, Arnold informed Bell that his company would undertake the new project. A contract was awarded on September 30. AAF leaders and Bell officials chose the designation XP-59A as a good cover for the true nature of this work because the designation originally referred to a piston engine fighter project proposed earlier by Bell. General Electric used a similar ruse. At that time, the company built aircraft engine superchargers with model designations &#x27;A&#x27; through &#x27;F.&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27; seemed to fit this pattern. &#x27;A&#x27; signified the first of a series so General Electric and the AAF designated the first American jet airplane engine the Type I-A.</td>\n",

The team was guided only by theory. General Electric would not finish and begin testing the first engine until March 1942 so Bell could only guess at the performance characteristics. In fact, neither the W.1X engine shipped from England in October 1941 nor General Electric&#x27;s own versions could generate the power levels initially predicted. Extreme secrecy and great urgency also hampered the project. For security reasons and to get the airplane flying as quickly as possible, General Arnold had at first forbidden use of wind tunnels to test and optimize the design.

Mechanics removed the &quot;propeller&quot; before flight and reinstalled it after the airplane landed. On October 1, 1942, Bell test pilot Robert M. Stanley took the XP-59A into the air for the first time. During this initial flight, Stanley kept the landing gear fully extended and flew no higher than 7.6 m (25 ft).

More powerful General Electric I-16 (J31) turbojet engines powered these and all subsequent production Airacomets. The first of 13 YP-59As arrived for flight-testing at Muroc in June 1943. One of these aircraft set a new unofficial altitude record of 14,512 m (47,600 ft). Although Bell proposed that the Army Air Forces should acquire 300 P-59 production fighter aircraft, the Army decided to order only 100.

Pitts began with an idea for an aerobatic aircraft that would defy gravity and be crisp on the controls. Rather than the larger pre-war biplanes, Pitts wanted something smaller that would climb, roll, and change attitude much more quickly. Instead of a large radial engine, Pitts built his aircraft around the new smaller and lighter horizontally-opposed engines. The swept wing allowed for access and center of gravity (CG) factors and made snap rolls snap more sharply. The resulting Pitts Special S-1 was revolutionary because of its small size, light weight, short wingspan, and extreme agility. The prototype S-1 was wrecked several years after its first flight.</td>\n",

The charges generated by the impact of the photons on the interior gas then traveled to the oppositely charged electrode. Additional collisions of the ions and electrons with filling gas on their way to the electrodes generated more charges and in effect amplified the signal.</td>\n",

The Huff-Daland Manufacturing Company of Ogdensburg, New York modified its Petrel 5 military/commercial biplane into a practical duster with a chemical tank and spreader system and formed the Huff-Daland Duster Company in Louisiana. C.E. Woolman soon took over the faltering company and with entomologist Dr. Bert Coad built a pioneering insect and chemical research and aerial delivery business throughout the country. Woolman also expanded the business to include passenger and freight carrying and renamed it Delta Air Service, which became Delta Airlines. With the deep Depression years of the 1930s and then World War II, further development of crop duster airplanes was shelved until after the war. Delta Airlines later restored one of the only two remaining original Huff-Daland Dusters and donated it to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air Museum in 1968; it now hangs at the Steven F.

The Stearman was a good airplane; however, it and other civil aircraft such as the DC-6 and Antonov AN-2M were never designed for sustained flying in this type of environment. Crop dusting is flying swaths of fields at extremely low altitude (8-10 feet), performing procedural turns at low altitude, and climbing and diving expediently for position and to avoid wires and trees. The field of flight must be exact to ensure precise, even application and contain drift of the load only onto the field and not onto homes or roads. Power management, maneuverability, and changing weight and balance combined with wind drift and specific application characteristics of the load add to the ever-changing equation for the pilot.

The aircraft structure would have to be very strong to accommodate the large hopper, payload, and accompanying spray/spreader equipment and sustain safe flight.

The Ag-Cat is a single-seat, strut-braced biplane with a 35 percent wing stagger which provides the excellent low speed wing stall characteristics that are necessary for low altitude maneuvers. The fuselage is constructed of a welded steel tubing truss which is covered with removable aluminum panels to facilitate post flight cleaning. The pilot&#x27;s safety reinforced open cockpit is protected with a headrest mounted turnover structure and the 33 or 40 cubic foot cargo bin (217 gallons or 1,200 pounds) is located in front of the pilot over the airplane&#x27;s center of gravity. The non-retractable fixed landing gear is of the conventional steerable tailwheel type with cantilever spring steel main landing gear legs. The wings are constructed of aluminum with two spars and are covered with a combination of aluminum sheet and fabric. All four outer wing panels are identical to make them interchangeable in the field. This feature also substantially reduces the spares inventory required. The tail unit structure is of the braced steel tube type and is fabric covered.

The cylinders were set at 90 degrees and were of two-piece design. They had a bore of 3 5/8 inches and the stroke was 3 1/4 inches. The head and pistons were also cast iron. The crankcase was of aluminum. Each of the pistons was fitted with four rings. The intake valves were automatic, atmospheric operated. The exhaust valve was push rod-operated from the camshaft. Curtiss used strong forged alloy steel for the internal components. The individual thin-wall cylinders and the head were attached to the crankcase with high tensile nickel alloy steel studs, contributing to the better-than-average lightness of the overall engine.</td>\n",

Plywood was fitted along the leading edge of the wings. The fuselage design followed that of a standard M-2 except that it was lengthened 2 feet. The cockpit was moved further to the rear for safety and the engine was moved forward for balance, thus permitting the fuel tank to be installed at the center of gravity.

Meanwhile, Army enthusiasm for the XP-61 produced another contract on March 10, 1941, for 13 service-test YP-61s. Even before these airplanes flew, Northrop received orders for 410 production machines! Northrop test pilot Vance Breeze flew the aircraft on May 26, 1942.

The 4-gun top turret was the same type fitted to the top forward position on the Boeing B-29 Superfortress (see NASM collection) and that bomber had production priority over the P-61. As a result, several hundred P-61s did not have this turret. Those that did experienced buffeting when the turret was traversed from side to side and a fix took time. By October 1943, the first P-61s were coming off the line. Training started immediately, and the first night fighters arrived in the European Theater by March 1944. Combat operations began just after D-Day (June 6) and the Black Widows quickly departed from their original role as defensive interceptors and became aggressors. They flew deep into German airspace, bombing and strafing trains and road traffic and making travel difficult for the enemy by day and at night.</td>\n",

For years, the Japanese had operated lone bombers over Allied targets at night and now U. S. fighters could locate and attack them. However, on June 30, 1944, a Mitsubishi BETTY (see NASM collection) became the first P-61 kill in the Pacific. Soon, Black Widows controlled the night skies. On the night of August 14-15, a P-61 named &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; by her crew encountered an intruding Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa (Peregrine Falcon) OSCAR (see NASM collection) and eventually forced it into the sea without firing a shot. Although the war was officially over, no one was sure that all of the Japanese had heard the message and stopped fighting. The American night fighters flew again the next night and &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; again found a target. It was a Nakajima Ki-44 Shoki (Demon) TOJO and the fighters maneuvered wildly as they attempted to gain an advantage. The P-61 crew lost and reacquired the Ki-44 several times then finally lost it for good and returned to base. The next day ground troops found the wrecked TOJO. In the darkness, Lady in the Dark&#x27;s crew had forced the Japanese pilot to fly into the ground, again without firing a shot.</td>\n",

       "            <td>Rather than investing in a completely new and expensive technology, Beech built a vastly improved and marketable business aircraft from its existing production line. After the King Air&#x27;s initial success, Beech concentrated on continuous upgrades to appeal to a range of executive and corporate needs. Sophisticated electronics packages, increased cabin space, and finer interior amenities in Models 90, 100, 200, 300, and 350 provided comfortable working and transport environments for business travelers. Newer models are longer and sport T-tails, but the basic configuration remains the same and continues to appeal as a new or previously owned medium-range aircraft. In addition to the airframe, the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine family consistently provides a high level of performance and reliability. Nearly 40 years since its introduction, the King Air series is still the king of the turboprops and fills a significant niche in the business aviation marketplace.</td>\n",

The Pfalz D.XII was a single-seat, two-bay biplane fighter of all-wood construction with a semi-monocoque plywood fuselage. It carried two forward-firing Maxim machine guns synchronized to fire through the propeller arc. The airplane was powered by a six-cylinder, 180-horsepower, water-cooled, in-line Mercedes D.IIIa engine. It had a top speed of 170 kph (106 mph) and a ceiling of 5,640 m (18,500 ft).</td>\n",

One hundred and twelve of these models were built. The aircraft received its airworthiness certificate on April 16, 1965 and was registered as N1920H. The exterior was white with Morning Glory Blue and Jubilee Gold trim and the interior was Frontier Green, Black and Arctic Beige. On April 23, 1965, the Aviation Department of Helmerich and Payne, Inc., of Tulsa, Oklahoma, purchased the aircraft and the company flew the aircraft almost every other day for many years, mostly around the Central Plains states. The aircraft&#x27;s registration changed to N10LE on October 8, 1973 and it flew in California, until May 20, 1976, when the registration was changed to N275DP. I FLY SOUTH of Wilmington, Delaware, owned the aircraft by 1994 and it then returned to Raytheon&#x27;s Beech Aircraft Corporation in March 1998. Stevens Aviation, of Vandalia, Ohio, performed general maintenance and painted it white with red and gray trim before Raytheon flew it to National Airport near Washington, DC, in April 1998. There, its flight career ended with 7,164.5 hours on the airframe. It was disassembled and trucked across the Potomac River to the Museum for installation in the Business Wings exhibit. In July of 2000, when the exhibit closed, Raytheon donated the aircraft to the Museum.</td>\n",

According to a 1949 letter from Louis C. &quot;Buck&quot; Kennell, the donor of the NASM airplane, these two Pfalz aircraft were brought to this country as part of Allied war reparations. Kennell also related that these airplanes were then sold as war surplus, brought to Hollywood, and appeared in the 1930 Howard Hughes epic, Hell&#x27;s Angels, and the first Dawn Patrol film, also made in 1930. Kennell&#x27;s assertion that the airplanes appeared in Hell&#x27;s Angels is probably true, but remains unconfirmed. After their use in Dawn Patrol, the two aircraft were sent to a Hollywood back lot for storage. Most of the existing film footage of the Pfalz comes from this movie, and there are several stills of the NASM aircraft from the film.</td>\n",

A fixed, water-cooled engine, capable of generating at least 150 horsepower, was in his view the power plant of the future. At this time, just such an engine was undergoing trials. It was a new Hispano-Suiza V-8, designed by that company&#x27;s founder and chief designer, a Swiss-born engineer named Marc Birkigt. The engine was a great step forward in that it had a much better power-to-weight ratio than previous water-cooled designs, as well as many other modern features. The new Hispano-Suiza engine was just what Béchereau was calling for. He designed his next airframe around the advanced Hispano-Suiza motor; the result was the famous Spad VII. By the fall of 1916, Spad VIIs were entering French squadrons and were well received. More than five-and-a-half thousand Spad VIIs were built.</td>\n",

Rolls-Royce sold less than 50 production engines, 32 of them to the Japanese.

It performed well and anyone reasonably handy with average shop tools could construct one in their own garage. Monnett first flew the Moni during July 1981. He sold about 380 kits from 1982 until his company ceased operations in 1986.</td>\n",

       "            <td>The finished Moni was a capable of flying basic aerobatic maneuvers such as loops and rolls and a Moni pilot could zip along at 193 km/h (120 mph) or stop the engine and glide around in search of thermal updrafts at a respectable 20:1 glide ratio. Airframe weight totaled about 118 kg (260 lb), a mere 1.8 kg (4 lb) above the legal weight limit for ultralights but the Moni was at least two times faster. This performance depended on a small and economical power plant, the KFM (Komet Flight Motors) 107 two-stroke air-cooled engine that Monnett included with all the kits he sold. This engine was not as reliable as many pilots hoped and several propeller failures occurred, too. Good performance also depended on a sound airframe but glue held the wings together in the early kits. After several wings failed in flight, Monnett redesigned the wings for riveted construction. Some builder/pilots were enthusiastic about the performance. One pilot said, &quot;I think that the Moni is a joy to fly. I have flown throughout Oklahoma, into Texas and Kansas. I took one cross-country that was 700 statute miles [1,127 km] round trip. The Moni does what it was designed to do very well. It is a good day VFR recreational aircraft.&quot; Harold C. Weston generously donated his Moni to the National Air and Space Museum in April 1992. Weston built the airplane himself and flew it more than 40 hours.</td>\n",

This aircraft was designated as the N2N and would be similar to the Consolidated NY-2s and NY-3s still in service. Following the production of this aircraft through 1929, the Navy requirement for a new primary flight traininer for the 1930s prompted the development of an important series of biplanes that served from 1938 through World War II. The N3N model, manufactured by the Navy Aircraft Factory (NAF) in Philadelphia answered the need. The N3N was used extensively as the primary trainer until the end of WWII. Outwardly, this aircraft appeared similar to the Consolidated NY-2 and NY-3. The major difference in the N3N was its structure, which featured riveted extruded aluminum fuselage construction with removable side panels for ease of inspection and maintenance. The wings, also constructed internally of all metal, were covered with fabric like the fuselage and tail.</td>\n",

The prototype, US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) Number 9991, went through service trials during February and March 1936. The trials recommended minor modifications, leading to the creation of another version, the XN3N-2. The NAF built one hundred and seventy-nine N3N-1s, with the first one delivered in June 1936. A fourth N3N-1 (BuAer # 0020) was modified as another prototype, XN3N-3. These two aircraft were fitted with navy built versions of the 240 hp Wright J-6-7 (R-760-96) engine, which was the same as that used in the NY-3s since 1929. The N3N-3, of which 816 were built, differed slightly from the -1. It had a redesigned vertical tail and a single strut landing gear.

Concerned with rising hotspots and international tensions, Mack met with ordinary citizens and dignitaries on his self-directed and self-funded global dialogue and peace mission. It provided a snapshot of a post-World War II and nuclear age world and made international headlines. Mack held talks with leaders of Middle East countries on the verge of dramatic change and stopped in Korea despite the ongoing war but was denied permission to enter the Soviet Union. Mack flew over mountains, deserts, and water in all kinds of weather and became the first person to solo the Pacific Ocean. He returned to Springfield, Illinois, on January 27, 1952, about 33,000 miles and 113 days after his depature. Congressman Mack flew the plane to Wichita, Kansas on April 19, 1952.

The Bonanza is regarded as a classic aircraft design of the post-World War II era and is easily identified by its distinctive V-tail. Though a number of other design refinements contributed to the efficiency of this airplane, the &quot;butterfly tail&quot; is the most distinguishing outward characteristic. This unique feature was tested during the waning years of World War II and found promising. The most important advantages of this design were the reduction in the number of parts and in weight.

Their desire to have a better airplane resulted in the formation of the Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company, in 1926, and the development of the Challenger series of three-place, open-cockpit biplanes starting with the C-1 and culminating with the C-4C. The principal differences between the various airplanes of the Challenger C series were the engines used in them. The C-1 and C-2 had 90 hp inline Curtiss OX-5 engines. The C-3 had a 110 hp 7-cylinder Warner Scarab radial, the C-4A had a 130 hp 7-cylinder Comet radial and the C-4C had a 165 hp, 5 cylinder Wright J-6 radial.

The Navy withdrew support from the project, primarily because it decided to focus on the development of air-cooled engines.

First deployed in 1982, some of the missiles began to be converted in 1986 to the AGM-86C with a conventional warhead and a Global Positioning System-aided navigation system.

       "            <td>Thise Mignet-Crosley Pou du Ciel is the first HM.14 made and flown in the United States. Edward Nirmaier and two other men built the airplane in November 1935 for Nirmaier&#x27;s boss, Powel Crosley, Jr. Crosley was president of the Crosley Radio Corporation. He believed that the Flea might become a popular aircraft in the United States. After several flights, a crash at the Miami Air Races in December 1935 grounded the Crosley HM.14 for good. In 1960 Patrick H. &quot;Pat&quot; Packard donated this Pou du Ciel to the Smithsonian. In 1987 Packard and Patti Koppa finished restoring the aircraft. The original ABC Scorpion engine was missing, so these two artisans fabricated a wooden replica.</td>\n",

Pou du Ciel (&#x27;poo-do-say,&#x27; literally &quot;Sky Louse&quot; but the English coined the term &quot;Flying Flea&quot;) is an appropriate name for this small, unusual aircraft. The novelty of the HM.14, along with Mignet&#x27;s effective marketing, compelled hundreds of people to build and fly the Pou du Ciel in France and Britain during the 1930s.</td>\n",

He became interested in aviation as a teenager and by age eighteen, he was corresponding with Gustav Lilienthal (brother to Otto, the famous German glider pioneer) about building aircraft. After World War I, Mignet began to experiment with powered aircraft. His first designs barely flew but in 1927 he built the HM.8, his first design capable of sustained flight.</td>\n",

He decided this airplane could fly without ailerons, elevator, and rudder pedals, and that he would use two main wings. He mounted one on struts above the fuselage and ahead of the pilot. To control pitch, the pilot pivoted this wing by moving a control stick fore and aft. Mignet mounted a second wing firmly fixed to the top of the fuselage behind the pilot. To turn, the pilot moved a rudder surface by swinging the control stick left or right. A generous amount of dihedral built into both wings caused the airplane to automatically bank when turning. Mignet claimed that any man who could nail shut a wooden crate could build his own HM. 14.</td>\n",

In August, Mignet flew his HM.14 to Britain and soon gained widespread attention. Construction began on hundreds of HM.14 airplanes and builder/pilots received permits to fly more than 80. The Flea&#x27;s performance appealed to many; the maximum speed of the average Flea was between 80 and 105 km/h (50-65 mph), depending on the engine, the flying weight, and the quality of construction. A pilot could fly from 80 to 161 km (50-100 miles) before needing to refuel and she could usually take off in less than about 180 m or 600 ft.</td>\n",

In April 1936 the first British fatality occurred. The authorities saw pilot incompetence as a leading factor in the crashes until May 1936 when Royal Air Force Squadron Leader C.R. Davidson died. Government officials in both France and Britain banned flights and subjected the HM.14 to wind tunnel tests. The results showed that under certain flight conditions, the pilot could not recover from a dive. Based on their findings, Mignet soon modified the design and solved most of the problems but the bubble of public infatuation with the Flea had burst. He continued his efforts to produce new aircraft and built a factory in the United States to make parts, but Mignet never recaptured the initial public interest first shown the HM.14.</td>\n",

With the help of Dan Boedeker and Herb Junkin, Nirmaier began construction on October 1, 1935. Funded by Crosley, he used materials readily available near the airport at Sharonville, Ohio. He even scrounged an ABC Scorpion engine. Nirmaier made the first test flight exactly one month later on November 1. This became the first HM.14 built in the United States. Nirmaier had adhered closely to Mignet&#x27;s plans in constructing the aircraft, deviating only in the methods used to weld several parts. Powel&#x27;s daughter, Page, christened the plane La Cucaracha (The Cockroach) using a bottle containing water from the Atlantic Ocean near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This was the site of the first successful flight of a powered, heavier-than-air flying machine, the 1903 Wright Flyer (see NASM collection). The U. S.

It flew well, but on the first day, a gust of wind flipped it over while taxiing. Nirmaier quickly repaired the damage and took the aircraft aloft for a short flight two days later.

Correction of these difficulties resulted in the complete redesign of the airplane, including all-metal construction, a single vertical fin, retractable landing gear, and 150 hp Lycoming 0-320-A engines with constant speed propellers.

Commuter service between Richmond and Hampton Roads was not as profitable as anticipated, so Davenport reorganized as Aviation Specialists Inc. for charter service from Maine to Florida and all points in between and multi-engine flight training. Davenport carried such notable passengers as Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr. and movie star Marion Davies. In addition to the charter work, this Apache was a popular twin-engine flight trainer for aspiring corporate and airline pilots.</td>\n",

At Culver, they had built the pre-war Culver Dart and Culver Cadet that became the production PQ-8 and PQ-14 pilotless aircraft and target drones during World War II.

Performance was acceptable but some high angle of attack buffeting was encountered. This was corrected through wing leading edge modifications and the addition of a trailing edge wing root fillet. However, the most severe problem was the modified 25 hp Crosley automobile engine conversion used to power the airplane. With a series of exhaust valve failures and a crank shaft failure during the engine and flight tests, the finall CAA certification was delayed until July 30, 1948. The Crosley powered M18s were subsequently retrofitted with the 65 hp 0-145 Lyncoming engine.

The tail section is a plywood-covered wood structure that is itself covered and sealed with fabric. The cockpit is enclosed with a sliding canopy and the airplane can be flown with it in the closed, open, or vent position. The cramped cockpit has a standard stick and rudder pedals with toe brakes. The tricycle landing gear is manually retracted with a lever in the cockpit and the nose wheel is steerable.
